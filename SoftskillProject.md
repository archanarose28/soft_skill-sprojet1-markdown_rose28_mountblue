# **NoSQL**

NoSQL data models allow related data to be nested within a single data structure.

A NoSQL database provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases.

## **Why** **NoSQL**
* The pace of development with NoSQL databases can be much faster than with a SQL database
* The structure of many different forms of data is more easily handled and evolved with a NoSQL database
* The amount of data in many applications cannot be served affordably by a SQL database
* The scale of traffic and need for zero downtime cannot be handled by SQL
* New application paradigms can be more easily supported


##  **NoSQL Features & Capabilities**

* Performance

* Availability

* Multi-Model

* Concurrency

* Security

* Scalability

* Data Model Flexibility

* Deployment Model Flexibility


## **Types of NoSL Databases**



 

1. **Document Databases**

   A document database stores data in JSON, &nbsp;BSON ,&nbsp; or XML documents. &nbsp;In a document database, &nbsp;documents can be nested.&nbsp; Particular elements can be indexed for faster querying. 



   Documents can be stored and retrieved in a form that is much closer to the data objects used in applications, &nbsp;which means less translation is required to use the data in an application. &nbsp;The most widely adopted document databases are usually implemented with a scale-out architecture,&nbsp; providing a clear path to scalability of both data volumes and traffic.

2. **Key-value stores**
  
   A key-value store is like a relational database with only two columns:&nbsp; the key or attribute name and the value.

3. **Column-oriented databases** 

   While a relational database stores data in rows and reads data row by row, a column store is organized as a set of columns.   
   
   This means that when you want to run analytics on a small number of columns,&nbsp; you can read those columns directly without consuming memory with the unwanted data.

   Columns are often of the same type and benefit from more efficient compression, making reads even faster.&nbsp; Columnar databases can quickly aggregate the value of a given column (adding up the total sales for the year, for example).&nbsp; Use cases include analytics.

   

4. **Graph databases**

   A graph database focuses on the relationship between data elements. &nbsp;Each element is stored as a node (such as a person in a social media graph). &nbsp;  The connections between elements are called links or relationships.&nbsp; In a graph database, connections are first-class elements of the database, stored directly.&nbsp; In relational databases, links are implied, using data to express the relationships.

   A graph database is optimized to capture and search the connections between data elements, overcoming the overhead associated with JOINing multiple tables in SQL.

## **List of the Different NoSQL Databases**

1. **MongoDB**

MongoDB is the most widely used document-based database.&nbsp; It stores the documents in JSON objects. &nbsp; According to the website stackshare.io, more than 3400 companies are using MongoDB in their tech stack.&nbsp; Uber, Google, eBay, Nokia, Coinbase are some of them.

**Why MongoDB?**
* In case you are planning to integrate hundreds of different data sources, &nbsp;the document-based model of MongoDB will be a great fit as it will provide a single unified view of the data
* When you are expecting a lot of reads and write operations from your application but you do not care much about some of the data being lost in the server crash
* You can use it to store clickstream data and use it for the customer behavioral analysis

2. **Cassandra**

Cassandra is an open-source, distributed database system that was initially built by Facebook (and motivated by Googleâ€™s Big Table).   &nbsp;
 It is widely available and quite scalable.

**Why Cassandra?**
* When your use case requires more writing operations than reading ones
* In situations where you need more availability than consistency
* You require less number of joins and aggregations in your queries to the database
* Health trackers, weather data, tracking of orders, and time series data are some good use cases where you can use Cassandra databases

3. **ElasticSearch**


This is also an open-source, distributed NoSQL database system. &nbsp;It is highly scalable and consistent. &nbsp;You can also call it as an Analytics Engine. &nbsp;It can easily analyze, store, and search huge volumes of data.

**Why ElasticSearh**
* If your use case requires a full-text search, Elasticsearch will be the best fit 
* If your use case involves chatbots where these bots resolve most of the queries, such as when a person types something there are high chances of spelling mistakes
* ElasticSearch is useful in storing logs data and analyzing it

4. **Amazon DynamoDB**

It is a key-value pair based distributed database system created by Amazon and is highly scalable.&nbsp; But, it is not open-source.


**Why Amazon DynamoDB**

* In case you are looking for a database that can handle simple key-value queries but those queries are very large in number
* In case you are working with OLTP workload like online ticket booking or banking where the data needs to be highly consistent
5. **HBase**

It is also an open-source highly scalable distributive database system.&nbsp; HBase was written in JAVA and runs on top of the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS).

**Why HBase**
* You should have at least petabytes of data to be processed
* If your use case requires random and real-time access to the data, then HBase will be the appropriate option
* If you want to easily store real-time messages for billions of people
